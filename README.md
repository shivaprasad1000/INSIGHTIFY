# INSIGHTIFY
 Insightify is a powerful analysis tool designed for product managers, marketers, and data analysts. By simply uploading a CSV or XLSX file of raw customer reviews, the application leverages the advanced capabilities of the Google Gemini AI model to perform a deep and nuanced analysis.

It goes beyond simple keyword counting to deliver a rich, interactive dashboard that provides an at-a-glance executive summary, a precise sentiment breakdown, and automatically discovered feedback categories. The standout feature is a dynamic Venn diagram that visualizes the overlap between topics, revealing complex relationships in customer feedback that would otherwise be missed. This tool turns unstructured review data into clear, strategic insights.
